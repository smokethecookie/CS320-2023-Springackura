Please implement a function that converts a given
xlist 'xs' into another xlist 'ys' by removing the
constructor 'mylist_reverse':
//
fun xlist_remove_reverse(xs: 'a xlist): 'a xlist

In particular, your implementation should guarantee:
1. 'xs' and 'ys' represent the same list

3. 'xs' and 'ys' use the same number of 'mylist_append'
